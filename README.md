Gallery-view script for [mpv](https://github.com/mpv-player/mpv). Shows thumbnails of playlist entries in a grid view. Works with images and videos alike.

# Important

* **The default thumbnail directory is probably not appropriate for your system.** See Installation for instructions on how to change it.
* **Make sure that the thumbnail directory exists for auto-generation to work.**
* **Also make sure to have ffmpeg (and ffprobe) in your PATH.** Or use mpv for thumbnails generation (not recommended : slightly slower, no transparency), see settings.
* The gallery is slower when using lua5.1, if possible use lua5.2.
* The script is meant to be used (and works best) with local files.

# Installation

Copy `scripts/gallery.lua` to your mpv scripts directory.

If you want on-demand thumbnail generation, copy `scripts/gallery-thumbgen.lua` too. You can make multiple copies of it (with different names) to potentially speed up generation, they will register themselves automatically.

If you want to customize the script (in particular the thumbnail directory), copy `lua-settings/gallery.conf` and modify it to your liking or edit gallery.lua directly (not recommended).

The gallery view is bound to `g` by default but can be rebound in input.conf with `t script-message gallery-view`.

# Thumbnail generation

By default, thumbnails are generated on-demand, and reused throughout mpv instances.

Thumbnails can also be generated offline by running this shell snippet (modify according to your needs):
```
w=192
h=108
thumb_dir=~/.mpv_thumbs_dir/
IFS="
"
for i in $(find . -name '*png'); do
    hash=$(printf %s $(realpath $i) | sha256sum | cut -c1-12)
    # for video, seek forward in the file to generate a better thumbnail
    ffmpeg -i $i -vf "scale=iw*min(1\,min($w/iw\,$h/ih)):-2,pad=$w:$h:($w-iw)/2:($h-ih)/2:color=0x00000000" -y -f rawvideo -pix_fmt bgra -c:v rawvideo -frames:v 1 -loglevel quiet "$thumb_dir"/"$hash"_"$w"_"$h"
done
```

# Flagging

When the gallery is open, you can flag playlist entries (using `SPACE` by default). Flagged entries are indicated with a small frame. Then, when exiting mpv a text file will be created (default `./mpv_flagged`) containing the filenames of the flagged entries, one per line.

# TODO

* Add some kind of checkerboard pattern behind transparent thumbnails (ideally with an ffmpeg filter) (?).
* Option to start the gallery view on startup

# Limitations

Ad-hoc thumbnail library (yet another), which is not shared by any other program.

Management of the thumbnails is left to the user. In particular, stale thumbnails (whose file has been (re)moved) are not deleted by the script. This can be fixed by deleting thumbnails which have not been accessed since N days with such a snippet
```
days=7
min=$((days * 60 * 24)
# run first without -delete to be sure
find ~/.mpv_thumbs_dir/ -maxdepth 1 -type f -amin +$min -delete
```
You could even schedule it, with a systemd timer for example.

Thumbnails are raw bgra, which is somewhat wasteful. With the default settings, a thumbnail uses 81KB (around 13k thumbnails in a GB).

Cannot generate thumbnail for anything that relies on `youtube-dl`.
